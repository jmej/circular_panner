# circular_panner
simple vbap implementation for pure data

uses [Ville Pullki's vbap algorithm](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/research/cat/vbap/)

depends on 2 external libraries for pd:
vpab and pddp

both install via dekken / the built in package manager and run well on pd 0.48 at least, probably newer versions too.
